### Enhancements

* Support new components called lightning.


## 1.1.3 - 2015-10-19

### Features

* Add new parameter to show invalid files, not found files and files without xml. The new parameter is called ‘showValidatedFiles’ was added to deployment tasks, when it is with true value shows a list of invalid files, not found files and files without metadata, its value by default is true.

	This parameter can be used by parameter:

	>$gradle <Deployment_task_name> -PshowValidatedFiles=true

	Also It can be used into build.gradle file:

		 enforce {
		        srcPath = 'src'
		        showValidatedFiles = false
		  }

	Or into custom task :

		task simpleUpload(type:Upload) {
		         credentialId = "demo2015"
		         interceptors = ['truncateClasses']
		         excludes = "profiles"
		         showValidatedFiles = true
	     }

### Enhancements

* Add new TestSelector engine to infer TestClasses from ApexClass names by exploring class body. To infer TestClass from ApexClass names now there are two option:

	   to infer TestClasses from ApexClass from server:

	       -Pserver=true

       To infer TestClasses from ApexClass from local code:

	       -Pserver=false

	By default its value is false.



* Add 'specificFiles' parameter to Retrieve command. It is in order to retrieve components (vfcomponents, vfpages, classes, objects, profiles, permissionset, etc ) with the project's package.xml file in the Retrieve request and then download only the files/folders defined on '-Pfiles' parameter.

	E.G. Common use case: Retrieve profiles and permissionsets.

	Before having this parameter we were not able to retrieve only the profiles and permissionsets, because the following command does not send the project’s package.xml in the retrieve request, it generates a package.xml with the files defined on ‘Pfiles’ parameter.

	> $gradle retrieve -Pfiles=profiles,permissionsets


	It means that these components are retrieved with the SalesForce base permissions and does not with the ones defined on the project’s package.xml file (EG custom vfpages, custom objects, etc) that typically they are the components that we want to have in our local code.

	Now we are able to retrieve components based in the project’s package.xml file.

	> $gradle retrieve -Pfiles=profiles,permissionsets -PspecificFiles

	When we define -PspecificFiles parameter, the project’s package.xml goes in the Retrieve request and only the files/folders defined on -Pfiles parameters will be downloaded. It means that the retrieved components will be processed based in the
